Express JS

-To start a node JS project do
    - npm init --yes (this is sets the defaults of package.json as true)
- In the docs they talk about this express generator tool
- I thought that's a bad ideia, one of the express main goals is to be 
less opinionated, this tool is very opinionated, also express needs to be 
light, this tool install a bunch of things which I did not accesses if were
necessary but I for my purposes here, they are complete out of scope.
